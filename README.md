Metabase BI tool - SQL queries I've used

What is Metabase?
Metabase is the easy, open source way for everyone in your company to ask questions and learn from data

It's an open-source self-hosted BI reporting tool. Connect to your datasource to visualise data and make meaningful dashboards which can be shared within your organsiation


Personal Development:
I chose Metabase to plug some gaps in our company reporting tools. There was no budget available for new tools and I wanted a tool which I could take ownership of and use to streamline my existing responsibilties.
Using this tool I was able to automate monthly reporting to the management team and assist with key decision making processes that affect both my team and those around me.
